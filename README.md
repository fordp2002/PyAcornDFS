# PyAcornDFS
This project is intended to support manipulating Acorn DFS .ssd and .mmb files on a modern computer using Python 3.
It is an open source hobby project not at all ready for production use at the time of writing!

For the time being copy at least the two python files into a directory and run DFS_GUI.py to used.

Open a file (SSD or MMB) from the open menu and it should load into the tree. Then select node(s) and right click to export them.
